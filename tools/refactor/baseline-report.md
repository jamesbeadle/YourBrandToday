## Headline

**Code quality score 100.0%.** **0 of 0 source files are over the 100-line limit (0.0%)**; the worst file is 0 lines.

## Code quality score

| Element | Reading | Score | Weight | 0% at |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Standard baseline checks** | | **100.0%** | **5** | |
| Files over the line limit | not measured | not measured | — | 50% of files |
| Worst file, in limits over | 0 | 100.0% | 5 | 9 |
| Functions over the line limit | not measured | not measured | — | 25% of functions |
| Else blocks | not measured | not measured | — | 50% of branches |
| Duplication % | not measured | not measured | — | 20 |
| Explanatory comment lines | not measured | not measured | — | 50 per thousand lines |
| Inline magic values | not measured | not measured | — | 20 per thousand lines |
| Orphan components and functions | not measured | not measured | — | 10% of components and functions |
| Long member chain lines | not measured | not measured | — | 30 per thousand lines |
| Deeply indented lines | not measured | not measured | — | 30 per thousand lines |
| Overlong function names | not measured | not measured | — | 10% of functions |
| **Design pattern file count** | | **not measured** | **0** | |
| Files the patterns predict but are missing | not measured | not measured | — | 50% of predicted files |
| Entities outside their expected file count | not measured | not measured | — | 50% of entities |
| **Prose** | | **not measured** | **0** | |
| Conditions with calls tangled inside calls | not measured | not measured | — | 25% of branches |
| Conditions compared to a raw literal | not measured | not measured | — | 25% of branches |
| Accessor names that want to be a property | not measured | not measured | — | 10% of functions |
| **Widget adoption** | | **not measured** | **0** | |
| Markup written by hand where a widget should be | not measured | not measured | — | 50% of widget slots |
| **Input validation** | | **not measured** | **0** | |
| Doors that write without checking their input against the columns | not measured | not measured | — | 50% of write doors |

Each element scores 100% with no offenders and falls in a straight line to 0% when its offenders, measured against the size of the codebase, reach the figure in the last column. The score is the weighted average of the elements that could be measured; an element that could not be measured lends its weight to the rest. Weights and zero points are set in `tools/refactor/rules.json` under `score.elements`. The offenders behind every reading are in `tools/refactor/audit-output/audit.json`.

## Against the baseline

No `baseline.json` beside the audit — nothing to ratchet against.

## Worst files by length

All files are within the limit.

Full detail, including every offender list, is in `audit.json`.
